We used guards here instead of patterns because we're testing for a boolean condition. If n is less than or equal to 0, return an empty list. Otherwise return a list that has x as the first element and then x replicated n-1 times as the tail. Eventually, the (n-1) part will cause our function to reach the edge condition.
